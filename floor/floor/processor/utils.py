    """Utility decorator that interpolates a `get_next_frame` call according to bpm or time.

    You can think of this decorator as providing a TTL cache decorator for
    the method it decorates, the TTL being dynamically computed from
    `context.bpm`.

    Here is an example of a trivial processor which changes colors once per
    quarter note:

        COLORS = [RED, GREEN, BLUE]

        @clocked(frames_per_beat=1)

            self.position += 1
            self.position %= len(COLORS)

            frames_per_beat: Period for a single frame, based on bpm. For example, a value of `1`
                will hold `get_next_frame` for the duration of a single beat (quarter
                note). Any numeric value is allowed; `4` means a whole 4/4 measure, where
                `0.5` means an eighth note.
            frames_per_second: Period for a single frame, in clock time. For example, a value
                of `30` will hold `get_next_frame` for the duration of (1/30.0) seconds, or roughly
